<h1>About Myself</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Christine Ma. I live in LA, moved here during Pandemic. I grew up in a small town called Harrison in New Jersey.  
    When I am not working, you can usually catch me trying out different restaurants or cafes in town. Besides exploring new cuisines, I also
    love traveling to various countries. One of the places I have on my bucket list is Egypt, and I hope to visit some time in the future</p>
